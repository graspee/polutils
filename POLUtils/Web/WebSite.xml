      <h3>1. What is POLUtils anyway?</h3>
      <p>
        POLUtils is a collection of utilities related to PlayOnline, Square/Enix' online gaming framework.<br/>
        It currently contains:<br/>
        <ul>
	  <li>an audio manager (with POL, TetraMaster and FFXI support - would add FMO support if I could get
	      someone to give me the info)</li>
	  <li>data browsers for Tetra Master and FFXI</li>
	  <li>an offline macro editor for FFXI</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
    </para>
    <para>
      <h3>2. What are the system requirements?</h3>
      <p>
        Well, POLUtils requires the .NET Framework 1.1 to be installed, and the Audio Manager has an additional
        dependency on Managed DirectX (part of DirectX 9 or higher) if you want audio playback (and that's a
        rather essential element of that perticular tool).  Unfortunately, Managed DirectX is not automatically
        installed along with DirectX - you can find a suitable installer for it on the downloads page.<br/>
        As for Windows version, any version of windows that can install those two dependencies should do (which
        basically means Windows 98 or later).  Future versions of POLUtils may use the 2.0 framework, which will
        probably require Win2K or later.
      </p>
    </para>
    <para>
      <h3>3. I get an exception saying Invalid Codepage - why is that?</h3>
      <p>
        FFXI uses a text encoding based on shift-jis, and it seems the .NET framework relies on a Windows code
        page to process shift-jis.  However, the shift-jis codepage isn't installed by default.  You can easily
        install it in one of two ways: either you enable support for East-Asian languages (Control Panel\Regional
        and Language Options\Languages), but that requires 230MB of disk space, or you can just make sure
        codepages 1250, 1251 and 932 are checked on the Advanced tab of the same control panel applet.
      </p>
    </para>
    <para>
      <h3>4. Why isn't POLUtils available in <em>&lt;insert language here&gt;</em>?</h3>
      <p>
	Easy - noone has volunteered to help with the translation yet.  If you want to provide the translation,
	let me know; all help is appreciated.
      </p>
    </para>
    <para>
      <h3>5. Is POLUtils going to steal my passwords or destroy my PC?</h3>
      <p>
	I sure hope not ^^.  POLUtils currently never ever connects to the internet, so your passwords
	are safe.  As for destroying your PC, that's unlikely as well (of course, the .Net framework is
	Microsoft technology, so you never know).
      </p>
    </para>
    <para>
      <h3>6. Will you make a WinAmp plugin for .bgw/.spw files?</h3>
      <p>
	No.  I considered doing so, but decided against it since a) there already is such a plugin, and b) the
	WinAmp SDK is, well, crap (I never realized how great the foobar APIs were until I saw the WinAmp SDK).

    <news-item title="foo_pol 1.1 Released" author="Pebbles" date="January 20th, 2005">
      <p>I'm release an update to foo_pol today. Nothing spectacular, but rather useful.</p>
      <p><strong>New Features:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  There is a new "Fade Out (10 seconds)" loop option.  For looped files, this will cause
	  it to loop for a maximum of 10 seconds, with a slow fade.  This makes listening to looped
	  tracks more pleasant.  This feature was suggested by Feenicks on the FFXIOnline forums.
	</li>
      </ul></p>

    <news-item title="POLUtils 0.4.0 Released" author="Pebbles" date="January 16th, 2005">
      <p>Today I'm releasing POLUtils 0.4.0, a collection of PlayOnline-related utilities.</p>
      <p><strong>New Features:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  POLUtils is deployed via an installer now - this also checks for the presence of the .NET
	  framework 1.1, to avoid unexpected and/or cryptic Windows errors.
	</li><li>
	  The language choice on the main dialog will now only list available options (and in its
	  native form).  Additionally, the selection will be preserved across runs.
	</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><strong>Fixes:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  There was a logic error in the data browser - if a second item data file was opened, the
	  item icons of the first one were reused.  This is now fixed.
	</li>
      </ul></p>
    </news-item>
    <news-item title="POLUtils 0.3.5 Released" author="Pebbles" date="January 15th, 2005">
      <p>Today I'm releasing POLUtils 0.3.5, a collection of PlayOnline-related utilities.<br/>
         This is really an intermediate release, there weren't enough major changes to
         warrant a 0.4 version.</p>
      <p><strong>New Features:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  The data browser has a menu now, that allows you to easily find several kinds of "interesting" files
	  (maps, item data, etc.).
	</li><li>
	  The data browser now has support for item data - not quite all available info has been figured out
	  at the moment (e.g. Rare/Ex/NoAuction flags).
	</li><li>
	  The data browser will now scan files for any images they may contain (instead of just checking the
	  start of the file and displaying the first one it found).  Unfortunately, this can take some time,
	  and you cannot abort the scan at the moment.  I will look into making that more convenient (improving
	  the speed probably won't be possible, but I'll try the too) - however, threading doesn't play very
	  nice when Windows Forms controls are involved, so it's a bit tricky.
	</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><strong>Fixes:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  Some of the picture loading code was broken and/or missing - the current data browser should
	  support most formats (DXT1-DXT5 and the various bitmaps) properly.
	</li>
      </ul></p>
    </news-item>
    <news-item title="POLUtils 0.3 Released" author="Pebbles" date="January 4th, 2005">
      <p>Today I'm releasing POLUtils 0.3, a collection of PlayOnline-related utilities.</p>
      <p><strong>New Features:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  You can select the interface language - only small portions have been localized at the moment,
	  and only for Dutch and Japanese.  Volunteers will be needed to assist further.
	</li><li>
	  FFXI Data Browser - allows browsing the contents of the .DAT files of FFXI.<br/>
	  Currently, only string tables (e.g. ROM\97\17-57.DAT) and maps (e.g. ROM3\4\0-20.DAT) will be shown
	  (although some non-map images will also be shown (e.g. ROM\0\1.DAT, which contains the game's font,
	  and ROM\97\10.DAT, which has the treasure chest texture).<br/>
	  I'll probably add menus in the next version to help locate "interesting" files.
	</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><strong>Fixes:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  POLUtils will refuse to start if no POL clients are installed (instead of crashing).
	</li><li>
	  The AudioManager now dynamically loads Managed DirectSound - previously it had a hard dependency on it
	  so for most people it would simply crash when started.  It also no longer tries to buffer the sound
	  files itself; this fixes the stuttering issue (although it seems DirectSound preloads the entire file
	  now, causing a noticeable delay when starting playback, and also causing a marked increase in memory
	  use).
	</li>
      </ul></p>

    <news-item title="POLUtils 0.2 Released" author="Pebbles" date="December 26th, 2004">
      <p>Today I'm releasing POLUtils 0.2, a collection of PlayOnline-related utilities.</p>
      <p><strong>Current Features:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>Audio Browser - allows playing &amp; decoding of all PlayOnline-related audio files.</li>
	<li>Macro Manager - allows editing of character macro bars (with auto-translator support).</li>
	<li>TetraMaster image viewer - allows viewing (and extracting) of the image files of Tetra Master.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><strong>Known Issues:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  Macro editing works, but is in a beta stage - I recommend using it on macro bars that are currently
	  empty, to avoid loss of data. Note that you need to explicitly ask the tool to save changes; so it
	  is perfectly safe to simply browse the macros.
	</li><li>
	  POLUtils loads the icons it needs at runtime (from POL and Windows files); if you run anything other
	  than WinXP, they may not look right. If that is the case, let me know (e.g. by sending screenshots
	  and mentioning what OS version you use).
	</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p><strong>Things I would like:</strong><br/><ul>
	<li>
	  The name mappings for the music and sound effect files is incomplete; if you can put a name to any
	  unnamed tracks, let me know.
	</li><li>
	  The "Insert Special Character" and "Insert Faces" context menu entries for the macro command text
	  are not implemented yet. I welcome suggestions, especially for the Faces category (the special chars
	  I can extract from the shift-jis character set).
	</li><li>
	  Any and all suggestions/requests are welcomed (new utility, new feature in existing utility, ...). But
	  please don't request a model viewer (yet) - that's outside the scope of my technical skills for the
	  moment.
	</li><li>
	  If you have the JP client and have Front Mission Online installed, please contact me, so I can get some
	  information from you.
	</li><li>
	  If you have the EU client, let me know - i need to verify some registry settings. If you can provide an
	  ISO or whatever of the EU POL Viewer disc, even better.
	</li><li>
	  Send in your favourite macros, for future inclusion in the standard macro library.
	</li>
      </ul></p>
