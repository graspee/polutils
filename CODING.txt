Main important Visual Studio setting: indentation: indent size 2, no tab insertion.
This can be easily configured by importing the POLUtils.vssettings files in Visual Studio.

An effort should be made to avoid placing TAB characters in sources, since they have a tendency
to make code appear different/ugly to different people, depending on editor/settings used.

A further solution-level settings file for ReSharper is provided as well.
If you have ReSharper installed, it should be used automatically.
