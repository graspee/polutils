A settings file for Visual Studio (POLUtils.vssettings) is provided which you can import to set up the proper indentation and
formatting settings for working on the POLUtils code.
Note that the use of automatic formatting of any kind is discouraged, because that tends to undo existing manual formatting.

More detailed coding and style conventions will be added to this file at some point.
