Requirements for building POLUtils
==================================

Main requirement is Visual Studio 2005. I think Visual C# Express 2005 is not enough (I don't think it does 64-bit builds).
A command-line Subversion client (svn.exe) needs to be in Visual Studio's executables path (either in the global PATH or specified via
Tools>Options, Projects and Solutions, VC++ Directories, Executable files) for the build to work (the current revision number is embedded
in the POLUtils executable). Convenient MSI packages (both for 32-bit and 64 bit) can be retrieved from http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download.

The solution also tries to build the website pages via a makefile; for this you'll need GNU make, cp (from coreutils) and xsltproc
(from libxslt). These are all available via the Cygwin project, and should be in Visual Studio's path as well (see above). Note that
this is completely optional - by the time the web site build is done, all relevant executables will already be built.

For building the translator kit, more GNU tools will be required (at least bash and awk). Advanced use only.

See also CODING.txt for coding and style guidelines, if you want to modify the code.
