Requirements for building POLUtils
==================================

Main requirement is Visual Studio 2010, 2012 or 2013.
For maintenance and patch creation, use of VS2010 is recommended (to avoid undesirable solution/project file changes).
Target framework should remain at v4.0 until further notice, to keep support for Windows XP.

A command-line Subversion client (specifically svnversion.exe) needs to be in Visual Studio's executables path (either in
the global PATH or specified via Tools>Options, Projects and Solutions, VC++ Directories, Executable files) for the build
to work (the current revision number is embedded in the POLUtils executable). Installing TortoiseSVN (a must for SVN use
on Windows, really) provides the option to install command-line utilities (and probably adds them to PATH as well).

Building the installer currently requires NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/).
This may switch to the Wix toolkit in the near future.

See also CODING.txt for coding and style guidelines, if you want to modify the code.
